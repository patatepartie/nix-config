### GnuCash

While the software works well when installed using HomeBrew (I didn't try with direct nix install),
I couldn't not figure out a declarative way to make the automatic retrieval of exchange rates work.

Using multiple currencies is explained [here](https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v5/C/gnucash-guide/chapter_currency.html)
but making the automatic retrieval is explained [here](https://www.gnucash.org/docs/v5/C/gnucash-manual/finance-quote.html).

The main command is to run `sudo /Applications/Gnucash.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnc-fq-update`.
Unfortunately, this does not work fully.
The rest is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash/comments/12c250i/online_quotes_stopped_working/).

I'm not 100% sure what are the minimal steps to make it work, but those ended up working:
- Follow [those steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash/comments/12c250i/comment/jh1y9ao/)
  - `sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell`
  - `install App::cpanminus`
  - `exit`
  - `sudo cpanm --uninstall Finance::Quote`
  - `sudo cpanm --uninstall JSON::Parse`
  - Quit Terminal and re-open with Rosetta enabled
  - `sudo /Applications/Gnucash.app/Contents/Resources/bin/gnc-fq-update`
- Now, following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GnuCash/comments/12c250i/comment/kuq2fgq/), run:
  - `sudo cpanm --force Finance::Quote`
- And back to the first link, test that it worked:
  - `/Applications/Gnucash.app/Contents/MacOS/gnucash-cli --quotes info`
  - It works if you get a list of APIs and not an error message
- Lastly, one step that was harder to find, following [this](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Online_Quotes#Source_Alphavantage.2C_US):
  - Get a Free API key on the Alpha Vantage [site](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (I already have one in LastPass, in `AlphaVantage API key`)
  - Set it in `GnuCash Preferences > Online Quotes > Alpha Vantage API Key`
